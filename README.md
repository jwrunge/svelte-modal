# Easy Modal
This is an easy modal, written in Svelte but usable not just as a Svelte component, but in vanilla JavaScript (or any other framework you may be using). It is intended to be:
* Quick to implement
* Highly customizable
* Easily stylable with a minimum of CSS
* Fun to play with

## Installation
Install via NPM:
`npm install jwrunge/svelte-modal`

Or include via script:
`<script src="">`

I recommend including the foundation stylesheet as well, unless they significantly break your designs. The foundation stylesheet is meant to be very minimal, allowing you quite a bit of control over the look and feel of your modals. See "Styling" below for more information.

With an NPM installation:
`<>`

Or via the GitHub link:
`<>`

Or download and link local copies of the script file and stylesheet.
