# Easy Modal
This is an easy modal, written in Svelte but usable not just as a Svelte component, but in vanilla JavaScript (or any other framework you may be using, because Svelte is magic). It is intended to be:
* Quick to implement
* Highly customizable
* Easily stylable with a minimum of CSS
* Fun to play with

## Development
Author: Jacob Runge
Website: [jacobrunge.com](https://jacobrunge.com)
GitHub: [github.com/jwrunge](https://github.com/jwrunge)
NPM: 

## Installation
Install via NPM:
    npm install jwrunge/svelte-modal

Or include via script:
    <script src="">

I recommend including the foundation stylesheet as well, unless they significantly break your designs. The foundation stylesheet is meant to be very minimal, allowing you quite a bit of control over the look and feel of your modals. See "Styling" below for more information.

With an NPM installation:
    <>

Or via the GitHub link:
    <>

Or download and link local copies of the script file and stylesheet.
